# rust-chores
Manage houshold chores using Rust

# Goal
1. The primary goal is to refresh Rust a bit and create a very basic
* commandline application ([clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap)) that uses 
* sqlite ([rusqlite](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite)) and 
* formats tables to stdout ([tabled](https://github.com/zhiburt/tabled)).

1. The seconday goal is to create a basic commandline application for managing:
- what chores exist 🌊
- how often they should be done 🕒
- who is responsible for what chore 🧚🏼 
- when the chores needs to be scheduled in someone's calendar 📅

1. And just have fun 😀
